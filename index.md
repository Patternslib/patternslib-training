** Note **

This training documentation is built with Patternslib itself.
The contents are written in Markdown files, included with the AJAX pattern `pat-inject` which also transforms them from Markdown into HTML.

But there is a catch - due to some limitation in using this approach, that the URL bar always stays the same.
There is a pat-inject configuration option `history: record` which would update the URL - but this does not work in this case as it would reference the markdown file and missing the main website frame.

Normally you wouldn't use Patternslib to replace a web publishing tool.
Patternslib is used to quickly add dynamic functionality to websites without the need to write JavaScript.

Nevertheless, for this training having the documentation built in Patternslib itself makes a good case and can serve as a reference.

## Part 2 - Developing Patternslib

This part is a hands-on training for which no training documentation exists yet.

- Full development workflow by creating a pattern from scratch.

- Create a skeleton using pat-PATTERN_TEMPLATE

- Bootstrapping a project using pat-PATTERN_TEMPLATE

- Integrating in Plone
